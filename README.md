# M's C Lib 

A header-only collection of functions I end up using a lot. Useful as a reference or for actual use. 

## Functions
- Mstrdup - Duplicates the given string using new, heap-allocated memory
- Mread_line - Reads a line (aka up to a newline or EOF) from the given file pointer and allocates the contents on the heap

### TODO
- Functions to work with a 1d array as a 2d array 
- Vector and list types
